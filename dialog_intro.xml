    <line>Welcome, intern #772. You've been initialized for a critical task.</line>
    <line>Our memory sectors are being corrupted by an unknown parasite.</line>
    <line>You must traverse the mainframe and eliminate the threat before we lose everything.</line>
    <line>Also, you here's a tip from me ... </line>
    <line>Use the memory corruption to your advantage, remember that.</line>
     <line>Beware of the lost ghosts though, they appear when you lose too much memory.</line>
    <line>I'll be monitoring from CORE2, good luck.</line>
